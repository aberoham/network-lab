# Testing OSPF convergence time

This uses some random topology. Put some links down, then watch how
much time is needed to settle. There are `monitor.*` files with
timestamps to get the right values. For example:

```
grep -h 23:53: monitor.V* | sort | awk 'NR == 1 { print } END { print }'
```

## Convergence tests with 1500 routers on a 6-core processor

When running on a Ryzen 5 5600X (6-core processor) and using the
provided values (30 VMs and 50 NSs each, hence 1500 routers and each
of them gets 0.4% of a core), we get the following convergence times.

No tuning has been done and notably, we are running in some netlink
overflows. Each router gets 0.4% of a core, which seems quite low.

## Same but with only 10 VMs

We get 500 routers and each of them gets 1.2% of a core. We have also
increased rmem to avoid dropped Netlink messages.
